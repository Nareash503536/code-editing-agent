# Conversational AI Agent with Memory using Go and Anthropic API

Built a conversation agent with memory using the **Go programming language**.  
The agent uses the **Anthropic API** (Claude models) for natural language interaction.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The program execution requires a **paid tier** on Anthropic.  
> Free-tier or trial accounts may receive errors like `credit balance too low`.

Before running the program, set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<create an anthropic api key and use here>"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install and run
```bash
# Download dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run the program
go run main.go
```

## üí¨ Example Output
